In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is utilized to analyze restaurant cuisine ratings data. By examining patterns and trends in customer ratings, EDA reveals insights into which cuisines are most favored, factors influencing customer satisfaction, and identifies anomalies in the data. This analysis aids restaurant owners in refining their menus, enhancing customer experiences, and developing targeted marketing strategies, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and business success.
